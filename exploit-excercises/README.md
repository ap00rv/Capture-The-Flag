### Level00

The first level is about finding a program with setuid bit set. Upon googling, I found that there is a find command option which can be used to find files with speficic permission bits. 

`find / -perm 4000` gives all files or directories with setuid bit in root directory. After running it and going through results, /bin/.../flag00 seems interesting.

```
flag00@nebula:/bin/...$ ls -al
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 root   root      29 2011-11-20 21:22 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root   root    2728 2012-08-18 02:50 ..
-rwsr-x--- 1 flag00 level00 7358 2011-11-20 21:22 flag00

level00@nebula:~$ /bin/.../flag00
Congrats, now run getflag to get your flag!

flag00@nebula:~$ getflag
